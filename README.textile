h1. foo-tunes

Project is aimed to help advanced music lovers with foobar2000
update their iPods with minimum usage of iTunes. Key features are:

* One-click synchronization
* Bidirectional playback statistics update between iPod/iTunes and foobar2000

h2. Motivation

There are lots of iPod sync software on the market but most/all of those use
some reverse engineered libraries to access iPod. Major iPod software
updates often brake those libs. On the other hand there's a lack of 
tools that allow precise control on what is done to your music. Among those
tools are excellent `foobar2000` media player and its great component
for syncing with iPods `foo_dop`. After release of iOS 5 it stopped working,
so I decided to write a tool of my own. It uses (and launches) iTunes
automatically but minimum effort is required.

h2. Prerequisites

* Windows (tested on XP)
* iTunes 10.5.2+
* foobar2000 1.1.10+
* run `prerequisites/register.bat` to register dll component allowing reading data from clipboard
* install these foobar2000 components and set them up as below
** Masstagger 1.8.4 http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_masstag
** Run Command 1.1 http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_runcmd
** Playback Statistics 3.0.2 http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_playcount
** Text Tools 1.0.5 http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_texttools

Command named `iTunesSync` for the `foo_texttools` plugin
must be created with the following content (excluding line break):

<pre>
{"Location": "%path%", "Rating": "%rating%", "PlayedCount": "%play_count%",
 "PlayedDate": "%last_played%", "DateAdded": "%added%"},    
</pre>

h2. Internals and TODOs

Main script is `foo-tunes.js` (modify variables in the first lines - at least
`pathToMusic` and `foobar2000`). Run it with `sync.bat`. The following actions
are performed:

* `pathToMusic` folder is scanned for new files
* album art is attached on the fly (iTunes is used)
* // TODO check whether foobar2000 is used otherwise just sync with files
* tags (see `tagMappings` variable in `foo-tunes.js`)
  are modified (foobar2000 tagger via masstagger is used)
* // TODO dead tracks, not found on disk, should be removed
* those not in iTunes library are added to it
* // TODO sync foobar2000 and iTunes statistics
* and then synced to iPod

h2. Recommended workflow 

Set up foobar2000 converter component to convert music to `pathToMusic` folder
(or file operations component if you do not want to convert - but I recommend
using Nero AAC Encoded as AAC provides better quality at a lower
bitrate than mp3). Do not forget to copy *.jpg along with music files.

Add `pathToMusic` as foobar2000 media library folder. This is required if you
wish to sync playback statistics with iPod. Stats is synced based on full
filename. Of course you do not want to see duplicates in your foobar2000 library.
There are several ways to solve that. I use excellent `foo_facets` component
to filter out tracks based on path, so I don't see those iPod-only tracks in the
library at all. Another way is to attach `pathToMusic` as media library before
every sync.
